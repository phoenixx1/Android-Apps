# Signup_Login_ParseServer

Signup and Login Functionality using Parse Server

I have used AWS for using parse server as database.
I used putty to get the required keys from the AwS and included in my project. Those values entered by the user are send to server and saved and can be viewed by admin, by using the login credentials
